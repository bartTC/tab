tab - Opens a new OS X Terminal window in the current directory and runs
an optional command in it.

If the current directory contains a file `.tabfile` this one is executed
instead (see below).

Installation:
-------------

Install it with pip: `pip install tab-osx` or if you prefer the manual way,
copy the `tab` file into your `/usr/local/bin` and make it executable:

    cp tab /usr/local/bin
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tab

Options:
--------

    (no arguments) Opens a new Terminal tab and changes to the current
                   directory.
    -n: Window name of  the new tab
    -w: Open a new window instead of a tab
    -p: Position of the new window on screen in the format x,y (e.g 400,200)
    -s: Size of the new window in the format w,h (e.g. 400,200)
    -t: Path to a tabfile to execute.

Example:
--------

    tab                                # Opens a new tab
    tab vim                            # Opens vim in a new tab
    tab -w -s 100,100 -p 400,700 vim   # Opens vim in a new window at the
                                       # specified position and size
    tab -t ~/Projects/project.tabfile  # Open the tabfile

Tabfile:
--------

You can specify multiple `tab` actions in one file, to quickly open multiple
tabs with commands. Tabfile is an INI file, each tab is seperated by a group
called either `tab:<n>` or `window:<n>`.

You can specify options as 'name:', 'size:', and 'position:'. All other
lines are commands which will be executed.
