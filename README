tab - Opens a new OS X Terminal window with the current directory and runs
an optional command in it.

If the current directory contains a file `.tabfile` this one is executed
instead (see below).

Options:
--------

    (no arguments) Opens a new Terminal tab and changes to the current
                   directory.
    -n: Window name of  the new tab
    -w: Open a new window instead of a tab
    -p: Position of the new window on screen in the format x,y (e.g 400,200)
    -s: Size of the new window in the format w,h (e.g. 400,200)
    -t: Path to a tabfile to execute.

Example:
--------

    tab                                # Opens a new tab
    tab vim                            # Opens vim in a new tab
    tab -w -s 100x100 -p 400x700 vim   # Opens vim in a new window at the
                                       # specified position and size
    tab -t ~/Projects/project.tabfile  # Open the tabfile

Tabfile:
--------

    You can specify multiple `tab` actions in one file, to quickly open
    multiple tabs with commands. Tabfile is a INI file, each tab is seperated
    by a group called either `tab:<n>` or `window:<n>`.

    You can specify options as 'name:', 'size:', and 'position:'. All other
    lines are commands which will be executed.

        [tab:1]                                     # Gulp Watcher
        source ~/myproject/bin/activate
        gulp watch

        [tab:2]                                     # Django Project
        source ~/myproject/bin/activate
        manage.py runserver

        [tab:3]                                     # A blank tab to work in
        clear

        [window:1]                                  # Vim Editor in a separate
        size: 200x400                               # window.
        position: 600x300
        vim
